<p></p>The Area Newsletter is a communication vehicle serving Western Washington Area 72 (WWA72). The scope includes WWA72 business, i.e. election results, committee appointments, motions, discussion topics, special committee activities, status of WWA72 trusted servants, and content provided by members of the Western Washington fellowship intended to carry the message of AA to the still suffering alcoholic.</p>

<p>The Newsletter also includes a calendar of events, which prominently features a categorized list of the dates and times of Area Service events, and other AA related events occurring throughout the Western Washington fellowship, i.e., campouts, luncheons, and picnics. Fliers related to the above events, registration, contribution, and subscription forms are consolidated in a separate section. Districts’ reports are encouraged.</p>

<p>The Newsletter Editor requests content each month from the WWA72 Committee, in particular elected & appointed officers, standing committees, special committees, Intergroups & Central Service Offices, and the DCMs for each of the 44 districts. All the above are encouraged to submit content that features a method of carrying the message in their sphere of duties.</p>

<p>The author’s first name, at minimum, will accompany all submissions. The Editor reserves the right to edit and/or refuse to publish content considered to be inconsistent with the three legacies: Recovery, Unity, and Service, with particular scrutiny given to content perceived to contain foul language and/or personal attacks.</p>

<p>The Newsletter is intended to be shared with all the members of the Western Washington fellowship and relies on the WWA72 Committee to generate content, overall awareness, and ensure distribution to the groups. It is distributed monthly, free of charge, to WWA72 elected and appointed officers, DCMs, and Alternate DCMs, GSRs of the registered WWA72 groups, past Delegates, GSO, Pacific Region Trustee, reciprocating Pacific Region Newsletter Editors, and the 15 Pacific Region Delegates.

<p>Hello Area 72!</p>

<p>I have been busy working with the amazing district and alternate district committee members to schedule the pre-conference assemblies in March. It's so fun to see the fellowship and FUN the neighboring districts are having together.</p>

<p>Around the time this is published I will be starting the pre-conference assemblies around Western Washington and it will be very important for general service representatives to attend!</p>

<p><strong>Purpose of the Pre-Conference:</strong><br>
Is for the Delegate to communicate with the GSRs (and through them the group) about agenda items which will be addressed at the General Service Conference (held in April). This meeting will provide information to help facilitate a discussion within the homegroup.</p>

<p><strong>Pre-Conference Information:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The locations have been determined, and flyers are now available on the Area 72 Events page. I've also attached information.</li>
<li>Keep an eye on the Delegate's Corner page on the Area 72 website—I'll continue adding information about the pre-conferences and other updates throughout the year.</li>
<li>We will have one hybrid and one virtual pre-conference for those unable to attend in person.</li>
<li>Our Central District session on March 23rd will include Spanish interpretation.</li>
<li>The final conference agenda and background materials ARE available. I am post them in a shared Google Drive linked in the Delegate's Corner.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pre-Conference Materials:</strong><br>
A pre-conference packet will be distributed before our first pre-conference via email. Printed copies will also be available. Expect this in early March.</p>

<p><strong>Providing Feedback to Your Delegate (me!):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After you attend a pre-conference, please have a discussion with your group about the topics covered.</li>
<li>Feedback on agenda topics will be collected through a Google Form to streamline submissions. The link will be in the Delegate's Corner and sent via email. However, you are always welcome to reach out via email, text, or phone.</li>
<li>I will be hosting a Share with Your Delegate session on April 12th (zoom) for those who would like to provide verbal group feedback.</li>
<li>All feedback is due by April 13th.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please let me know if you have any questions!<br>

<p><strong>ALTERNATE DELEGATE</strong><br>
<a href="mailto:altdelegate@area72aa.org">altdelegate@area72aa.org</a></p>

<p>Greetings Area 72,<br>
The newsletter topic this month is so timely! With the agenda items and background information for the General Service Conference recently released it is a wonderful time to be discussing what it takes to arrive at an informed group conscience. I look forward to reading what others have found as ways to form a group conscience!</p>

<p>In the month of February, I facilitated seven GSR schools. There is one more scheduled for early March and some District Committee Members (DCMs) have reached out, asking me to come to their district or to plan GSR sessions later in April.</p>

<p>These first sessions were intended as a high level crash course for General Service Representatives, Alternate General Service Representatives or members interested in learning about General Service. (Links to the GSR handbook and a useful page on the Area website are listed at the end of my article.)</p>

<p>One of the events that is encouraged for GSRs to attend is a Pre-Conference. (The dates and details of the Pre-Conferences can be found in this newsletter, and on the Area 72 website: <a href="https://area72aa.org/events/category/area-business/pre-conference/list/">https://area72aa.org/events/category/area-business/pre-conference/list/</a>)</p>

<p>At the Pre-Conference meeting you will be provided information and background by our Area 72 Delegate, Courtney S. Then you have the task of sharing the content and informing your home group so you can have a conversation and arrive at a group conscience regarding the topics given.</p>

<p>Groups have many different ways to facilitate this process and each group will find success in their own, different way. Some groups will want to read all the information and discuss all the topics provided by Courtney. Some groups will not be as interested and maybe will only be engaged for a topic or two. Wherever your group falls on that spectrum, the goal remains the same: share information, lead a conversation, share the results of that conversation (thoughts, concerns, questions) with Courtney, so she can be informed as she participates in the forming of a group conscience at the General Service Conference in New York.</p>

<p>I have seen groups have success in a variety of ways, and you can hear specific suggestions from your service sponsor, DCM or you can call me if you're struggling. As your group representative, you know your group the best. I subscribe to the belief that some conversation and some discussions are better than none. Some feedback about the topics will be more helpful to Courtney than none at all. Inform your group of any groundbreaking topics from the Conference agenda and do your best to facilitate a group discussion on however many topics you can.</p>

<p>Through this (Conference) process, your group gets to participate in conversations and decisions that will affect all of A.A. Through this process, your group can "take the final responsibility for their world services" (as Bill wrote in Concept I).</p>

<p>As referenced earlier, to access the GSR handbook, visit: <a href="https://area72aa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GSR-Handbook-P75.2.pdf">https://area72aa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GSR-Handbook-P75.2.pdf</a>. For a "one stop shop" for GSRs go to <a href="https://area72aa.org/gsr">https://area72aa.org/gsr</a>. Both of these are compilations and explanations of things a GSR can expect and what events to attend as a GSR.</p>

<p>As always, please reach out if I can help you, your district or your group. Thank you for the ability to serve Area 72.</p>

<p><strong>CHAIRPERSON</strong><br>
<a href="mailto:chair@area72aa.org">chair@area72aa.org</a></p>

<p>Greetings Area 72,</p>

<p>First, I want to thank you all for such a great first newsletter of the new rotation. There were so many great articles. Great job to our area 72 ink slingers! I read the whole thing; part of my new job description. Also, spring is coming. That means PRAASA is right around the corner as are our Delegate Courtney's Pre-Conferences and then the April Quarterly shortly after that. For those unfamiliar with PRAASA, it stands for the Pacific Region A.A. Service Assembly. Some history on PRAASA, it goes back to the 1960s shortly after the 1963 General Service Conference approved the multi-state grouping plan recommended by the 1962 Conference that organized the U.S. into six geographical Regions. Regional Trustees would be elected to the board as Class B Trustees. Shortly after that, this annual assembly was started to prepare the Delegates from the areas in the Pacific Region for the Conference, hence it's in March or every year. Two years ago was my first PRAASA and I was like "meh." After presenting last year and having such a great time, I couldn't wait for this year, I've been all packed and ready for months.</p>

<p>Second, I am excited for the upcoming April Quarterly. I have the Agenda drafted and I am looking forward to hearing an update from the Newsletter ad hoc committee and continuing the discussion. As for the Conference, I am especially interested in the deadline date for Proposed Agenda Items for the 2026 Conference. Are they going to keep it at September 30 or move it into October? Either way, I expect we will want to revisit some alternatives at our July Quarterly as we digest Courtney's report backs from the Conference. Anyway, I continue acclimating into the chair position and have had many conversations with many people since the Quarterly about the Quarterly, Robert's Rules and serving in the chair position to the best of my capabilities.</p>

<p>Third, as for you fellow service nerds, come join me at Seattle Intergroup every first Sunday of the month at 11:00 am for the Service Manual Study where our past Delegates Astri T. and Alan F. lead us through the service manual line by line with robust discussion and Bob F. brings his homemade cookies. Also, come join me every Thursday night at 6:00 pm on zoom for the Pacific Region Service Nerds weekly service meeting. I have the privilege of serving on the committee with some other Area 72 servants and we have a great schedule. Every 1st Thursday an Alternate Delegate from the Pacific Region presents on the Tradition of the month, the 2nd Thursday a Delegate from the Pacific Region shares on the concept of the month, the 3rd Thursday we read the corresponding chapter in the new Service Manual (Month 3 = Chapter 3, and so on) and the 4th Thursday we have a special guest speaker on the Chapter we read form the previous week. For example, when we read the chapter on the General Service Office, we will have a staff member from the General Service Office join us and share their experience working at the office. And if there is a 5th Thursday, we have past Pacific Regional Trustees share their experience, strength and hope in service and on serving as a trustee. Our Past Pacific Regional Trustee Madeleine P. shared with us in January and former General Service Trustee Paul C. from Area 08 San Diego will join us the 5th Thursday in March. For those who have attended past PRAASAs, he is one of the more colorful panelists during the Past Trustee shares on Sunday morning.</p>

<p>And last and as always, please feel free to reach out as I am available to any Intergroup, District or Home Group to share on service and/or personal recovery, to facilitate group or district inventories, or assist in group resolution or just answer random fellowship and/or service-related questions. Just email me as I am always happy to be of service.</p>

<p><strong>ALTERNATE CHAIRPERSON</strong><br>
<a href="mailto:altchair@area72aa.org">altchair@area72aa.org</a></p>

<p>Hi everyone! Did you know that over the past 7 years, only 38% of districts have had the chance to host an Area Quarterly? Let's change that! Hosting a Quarterly is more than just logistics—it's an opportunity to bring AA members together, ignite excitement for general service, and strengthen fellowship across the Area.</p>

<p>If your district hasn't hosted a Quarterly recently, I encourage you to explore potential meeting facilities that could accommodate 150–175 people. Great starting points include community centers, community colleges, or church fellowship halls. If your district doesn't have a suitable venue, consider partnering with a neighboring district to co-host. This can be a meaningful way to share resources and involve even more members in the process.</p>

<p>I'm hoping to receive two more bids from districts interested in hosting. By hosting an Area Quarterly, we give AA members the gift of service. They might discover something new about general service, feel inspired to get more involved, or form lasting friendships with others on the same journey.</p>

<p>To ensure we have plenty of options to choose from, I've spent time mapping out where quarterlies have been held over the past seven years to guide us:</p>

<p><strong>2018</strong><br>
January: D22 (Port Angeles)<br>
April: D27 (Long Beach)<br>
July: D8 (Olympia)</p>

<p><strong>2019</strong><br>
January: D31 (SeaTac)<br>
April: D29 (Puyallup)<br>
July: D4 (Mount Vernon)</p>

<p><strong>2020</strong><br>
January: D12 (Everett)<br>
April: Zoom<br>
July: Zoom</p>

<p><strong>2021</strong><br>
January, April, July: Zoom</p>

<p><strong>2022</strong><br>
January: D22 (Sequim)<br>
April: D24 (Everett)<br>
July: D9 (Lacey)</p>

<p><strong>2023</strong><br>
January: D15, D40, D41 (Seattle)<br>
April: D45 (Lakewood)<br>
July: D10 (Bremerton)</p>

<p><strong>2024</strong><br>
January: D34 (Bellevue)<br>
April: D57 (Mountlake Terrace)<br>
July: D8 (Lacey)</p>

<p><strong>2025</strong><br>
January: D24 (Lynnwood)<br>
April: D37 (Vancouver)<br>
July: D9 (Tacoma)</p>

<p>Since 2018, 17 districts (38% of our Area) have hosted quarterlies, while 27 districts (62%) haven't yet had the opportunity.<br>
<strong>Hosted (17 districts):</strong> 4, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 22, 24, 27, 29, 31, 34, 37, 40, 41, 45, 57<br>
<strong>Not Hosted (27 districts):</strong> 1, 2, 3, 7, 11, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 25, 28, 32, 33, 35, 36, 38, 39, 42, 43, 44, 46, 54, 55, 56, 58</p>

<p>I've been working with the following districts to prepare 2026 Quarterly bids that will be presented at the April Quarterly:<br>
D21 -- Preparing a bid for Grays Harbor County<br>
D22, D55, and D56 -- Joining forces for a bid in Sequim<br>
D14 and D31 -- Teaming up for a bid in Des Moines<br>
Meeting with these DCMs and Alt DCMs has been a joy. Hosting Area events truly brings love and service into action, proving that we are not a glum lot!</p>

<p>If you're interested in putting together a bid, I'm here to help! We can gather all the necessary information in just a week with a little effort. I'd love to partner with you and your district to spread the love of general service.</p>

<p>And, as an added incentive, I've offered to bake cakes for the districts that submit the first five quarterly bids this year. For those of you who haven't tried my cakes, they're truly delicious!</p>

<p>Looking forward to hearing from you!</p>

<p><strong>ACCESSIBILITY</strong><br>
<a href="mailto:accessibility@area72aa.org">accessibility@area72aa.org</a></p>

<p><strong>Accomplishments from the past month:</strong><br>
I was asked to give a 5-minute explanation of what Accessibility does in Western Washington Area 72, how it relates to the Districts and Home Groups. How important it is for Districts to have Accessibility Chairs. I got to make this presentation to District 10, 25 and 36. Thank you for the invites, it was my honor to spend time with you all and participate in your business meetings.<br>
We have an excel spreadsheet with the district contact information for each district up to date. We had 16 accessibility chairs/liaisons/DCM's connected together out of the 44 districts at the end of January, I am happy to say we added 10 more so we have 26 our of 44 Districts that will be represented at our next quarterly.</p>

<p>I attended the CPC quarterly and was asked to share about how Accessibility and CPC intersect. Thank you Sooz, it was a wonderful quarterly and your group is going to do wonderful things this rotation.</p>

<p><strong>Problems or issues you are facing or have already dealt with:</strong><br>
I am from District 09. We do not have a district Accessibility Chair. We have a district liaison that attends monthly Accessibility meetings at the CSO in Tacoma along with 3 other district Liaisons and Home Group Accessibility Representatives. This monthly meeting can get big, 20-40 participants. They elect a chair, secretary, treasurer, they create sub-committees to do the work as small groups and all of them help each other to do good work as a large team.<br>
I am learning that some districts have an Accessibility Chair and that some of those districts do not have home group Accessibility Representatives, so the Chair is a committee of one. This breaks my heart, I cannot Imagin going it alone.</p>

<p><strong>Please share some goals you hope to achieve or begin work on in the next month.</strong><br>
I want to help the rest of the Districts to get their services chair positions filled and attending our April quarterly.</p>

<p><strong>What am I grateful for?</strong><br>
District 25 for electing Aarin R. as the District Accessibility Chair<br>
WE have a District that is hosting our April Quarterly and a District checking to see if they want to host the July quarterly. We want Districts to host next year's quarterly's as well.</p>

<p>Hey Area 72!<br>
I would like to share with you that it has been a joy to be your Archives Chair. In these past few months as I have been getting up to speed, I have learned how important maintaining archives is to preserving the historical facts of our Area. There are several intricacies that go into preserving and storing an artifact and/or document. I have been enlightened to see how much work goes into saving our Area history and making it available to all those who wish to learn about Area 72. In just this past month an author had asked to come to our repository so he could conduct some research. We also had someone fly across the country to take a look at our archives because their area is going through an experience and they want to know how Area 72 got through a similar challenge. I am impressed that people know what it is that we have stored on a national level. Most importantly, I am serving with enthusiastic and light hearted individuals who love Alcoholics Anonymous. I am so happy that I get to serve with these people throughout this rotation.</p>

<p><strong>CORRECTIONS CHAIR</strong><br>
<a href="mailto:corrections@area72aa.org">corrections@area72aa.org</a></p>

<p>The AA General Service Conference is a pivotal gathering where our area delegates come together to discuss and make decisions for "AA as a whole." As I've not been a delegate, I've not had the opportunity to travel to the Conference. However, during panel 74, I was a DCM, and I had the opportunity to witness our delegate fulfill her responsibility to the groups by bringing the information from the conference to our area 72 groups. This process looks different depending on which service position I am holding. Actions taken as a DCM were much different as a GSR, and this year, as a corrections chair, I get to be a cheerleader for everyone!!!</p>

<p><strong>The General Service Conference: Sharing the Topics With Your Group</strong></p>

<p>One of my fall-back traits is contempt prior to investigation (CPtI). Ray C brought this quote, attributed to Voltaire or Shakespeare, to our attention in his story, The Artist's Concept, from the first edition. He led off his story with the quote, which was later included at the end of the Spiritual Experience, Appendix III, pg 166, in the Plain Language Big Book. Ray designed the red and yellow cover for the book, Alcoholics Anonymous. His story is also collected in the book Experience, Strength and Hope. Due to my CPtI, I tended to "dislike new ideas before [I] knew anything about them." I could barely listen in my early sobriety to trusted servants as they shared the topics for the General Service Conference.</p>

<p>I'll take full responsibility for my slow arc in service, becoming GSR and then DCM ten years into sobriety. That slow arc gave me time to trust another alcoholic or two. A recent A.A. Grapevine Daily Quote reminded me how my sponsor would talk me through my CPtI about service topics, much like they would when I was in my early days of sobriety. "Empathy, not sympathy or pity, is the most useful quality a sponsor can cultivate." (from District 34, Bellevue January 1975, "Need a sponsor? Who? Me?" reposted on AA GV app February 11, 2025).</p>

<p>My sponsor fortunately had more time and patience than I did. By his example, I attended business meetings, even when I wasn't mentally present. My sponsor is invaluable for discussing the topics themselves, how to talk about them, their background, so that I can be better engaged in the process. As I gathered the courage to ask questions about the process, my sponsor explained, listened, and endeavored to take personalities out of the equation. In general, he helped me ease past my CPtI.</p>

<p>At the recent Grapevine/Literature Quarterly, a member asked for background on changes to literature. I was personally vested in changes to language in the Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions a few years back, and enjoyed being able to dive deep into the machinations A.A. went through to publish and then to not un-publish the book. The GSC pre-conference material our Delegate makes available has a wealth of information. When I find even one topic that catches my interest enough, I can then talk about the process, where the topic came from, what kind of input our Delegate is seeking.</p>

<p>Read over what our Delegate provides. If a topic piques my interest, and I do more research, then it might be an engaging topic for someone else. The upside down triangle might begin to make sense. Leading up to the GV/Lit Quarterly, I focused intently on information about the Grapevine, only to be gobsmacked when a rep asked about the Literature Handbook. "What? There's a literature handbook as well as a Grapevine Handbook?!" We are all volunteers, and we are teaching each other. Empathetically, we helped each other stay sober one day at a time; now in service, I learn how to be useful one day at a time, with empathy, not sympathy or pity.</p>

<p><strong>Getting Into a Groove</strong></p>

<p>Hello Area 72!</p>

<p>As I settle into my role as Area Language Coordinator, it's been an exciting and productive month. The Hispanic Districts have decided which committees they'd like interpreted for this rotation: Public Information and Grapevine/Literature. To support this, we provided interpretation at both the Public Information and Grapevine/Literature quarterlies this past quarter, and will continue to do so for the remainder of Panel 75. Additionally, we offered interpretation at the GSR School on February 9th.</p>

<p>We also held our first Language Steering Committee meeting, which had a fantastic turnout! During the meeting, we elected a Committee Secretary and discussed creating a new position: the Interpretation Equipment Coordinator, responsible for coordinating the transportation of interpretation equipment to and from Area events. Since the start of the year, we've translated over twenty-five documents—totaling more than eighty thousand words.</p>

<p>Much of my focus this past month has been on creating systems to streamline our translation and interpretation services for Area 72. This has included revising the P75 Language Committee Hand-off Document, building an annual events calendar for interpretation tracking, and delegating tasks to our enthusiastic committee members.</p>

<p>I want to express my heartfelt thanks to our interpreters for their dedication over the past two months, as well as their patience with me as I transition into this new role. A special thanks to Claudia—our lead interpreter and translator—who has truly been a rockstar and a joy to work with. Her willingness to make herself available for Area 72 has been invaluable, and we are incredibly grateful for her time and expertise.</p>

<p>I'd also like to thank the members of our newly formed Language Steering Committee. We'll be meeting monthly to delegate tasks and ensure no one person is overwhelmed with too much work. As a reminder, we're all volunteering our time, and one of my main goals this year is to make sure the service work remains balanced and enjoyable. If you're interested in attending a Language Steering Committee meeting, please reach out to me at the email listed below.</p>

<p>I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to serve Area 72. I look forward to seeing you all at the April Quarterly!</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br>

<p>I am getting better at this with each edition of the newsletter. I am aware that I need to get the word out on the topic with more lead time and I am currently working with the AdHoc committee to improve the content, cost and delivery for the Area Newsletter.</p>

<p>My goal is to get the Spanish Language version published much quicker than I did for my first issue and improve the accuracy of the Events section.</p>

<p>The General Service Conference is one of the highlights of the year for General Service. Participating in the group conscience is an important part of keeping AA vital and healthy.</p>

<p>I am heading to PRAASA this coming week and I am eager to explore how other areas utilize their area newsletters to share information and ideas.</p>

<p><strong>Newsletter PI Quarterly Report</strong></p>

<p>Greetings!</p>

<p>Area 72 PI had their quarterly meeting on February 8th from 10:00 am – 2:00 pm we had 11 people online and 16 people in person, additionally our interpreter Claudia was present to assist with Spanish interpretation. We also had our Corrections Chair Aimee, our Language Chair Charley, and past Delegate Bob F. in attendance, thank you for your support!</p>

<p>The focus of our first Quarterly was for us to get to know each other, learn about Public Information and how to form a PI Committee. We reviewed the difference between Public Information and Cooperation with the Professional Community and the nuances between the two.</p>

<p>In our discussions of where to start in forming a committee we focused on informing the Fellowship and how that could look, attending business meetings, having workshops, etc. We reviewed the resources available and shared our goals for the rotation. Some of the resources we highlighted outside of the PI resources provided by GSO were the Language of the Heart, the new podcast Our Primary Purpose, and the A.A. Fact File. Bob F. shared that the Fact File is a great resource for anyone who does service work and especially for those doing public information service work. Being we were at The Greater Seattle Intergroup I think about 15 A.A. Fact File booklets were purchased that day!</p>

<p>Everyone shared what they are doing in their individual districts, and we had great dialogue with each other. Brian, Dee Dee, and Kathy are forming their committees and reaching out to libraries to ensure there are Big Books and information racks. Cindy is holding an all-day conference on Safety & Anonymity. We had a good discussion around anonymity regarding social media and were reminded that we can always direct our questions to GSO and will receive a thoughtful, well-formed answer.</p>

<p>The topic of a PI Workbook Study was brought up and we unanimously voted yes to have a monthly study on zoom- the last Sunday of each month at 3:00 pm.</p>

<p>For our next Quarterly we will highlight Speaking at Meetings Outside of A.A. and reviewing the downloadable videos available to show to the public.</p>

<p>Thanks to Cindy, Angel, and Kurt for volunteering to host the remaining Quarterlies!</p>

<p>Looking forward to an exciting year in Public Information.</p>

<p>In love and service,<br>
Julie</p>

<p><strong>REGISTRAR</strong><br>
<a href="mailto:registrar@area72aa.org">registrar@area72aa.org</a></p>

<p>In the past month I have entered 200+ new trusted servants into the GSO Fellowship Connection Database and approximately the same into the Area 72 Newsletter. I believe I am approximately working on this 3 to 5 hours a day – thank you for retirement.<br>
And, I want to be honest and let you know I am NOT up to date yet...</p>

<p>It has been a hope of mine that I cull the Newsletter list at the same time and hopefully my methods are working. I am doing this to get a handle on who should be receiving the newsletter and how many newsletters should they receive based on how many service positions they are currently serving in. When I think of this (of course in my own head and sometimes actually out loud – lol) it sounds so easy, but in all actuality, it is not!<br>
AAAHHH, the joys of my service position...</p>

<p>Honestly, there is a joy in learning and working my program to find the courage and sometimes strength to ask for help from GSO when I spend an hour trying to figure out where and what the person's last service position is so the database will allow me to enter the new position by end dating it and entering the new one. A bit of insanity as I try and try and then always send a note to membership services to please find it on their end. Of course, they do, and they are so much kinder than I am being to myself. Also, I have allowed myself to just call the member who I am trying to help and asking them for help with their information and they too are always so kind and happy to help. Because, we are a friendly lot.</p>

<p>I continue to work on my backlog every day and find gratitude in being of service, learning, communicating, staying in the middle of the boat of Area 72 AA and asking my HP to give me the will and the direction for this service and for my sobriety and recovery.</p>

<p>'The General Service Conference, Sharing the Topics with Your Group'</p>

<p>Many people in A.A. believe the Alcoholics Anonymous General Service Conference (GSC) is something that happens in New York and has very little to do with what they, as an A.A. member, do on a day-to-day basis.</p>

<p>They couldn't be further from the truth. We, as A.A. members, are the reason why there is a Conference.</p>

<p>If we, at the group level, are not getting the Conference agenda items and discussing them, we are doing a great disservice to A.A.<br>
Concept I, of the Twelve Concepts for World Service", states, "The final responsibility and ultimate authority for A.A. world services should always reside in the collective conscience (my emphasis added) of our whole Fellowship."</p>

<p>That's us, from the individual member to the Group, to the District, to the Area, and, by way of our Area Delegate, to the GSC.<br>
We A.A. members at the Group level should not only be waiting on our General Service Representative (GSR) to share the Conference topics, but we should also be anticipating it as a service to A.A. and be willing to give of our time and resources to ensure it happens before our Delegate goes to N.Y.</p>

<p>The GSR prepares by attending one of the pre-conferences set up by the Area Delegate, receiving the current agenda items and background information, and participating in the pre-conference discussion. The GSR then emails the information packet to each member of our Group and sets up a time and location for them to get together.</p>

<p>This time is usually separate from our group meeting or business meeting time and dedicated to the selected Conference agenda items.<br>
We may have a potluck or get together and do phone service at the Central Service Office at the same time as we discuss the items on the agenda. Notice I said "discuss", we don't just do a vote on each item, we talk about it, often at length, to ensure the group is aware of the pros and cons of each topic to guarantee a thorough knowledge prior to polling the group conscience.</p>

<p>Our GSR will then send our group's decisions on the agenda items to our Area Delegate so they have a knowledge of how our group and it's individuals feel regarding these matters. Group individuals are also informed that they may send their own opinions to the Area Delegate via email, by a specified date, if they so desire.</p>

<p>It is also very important that once the Delegate returns from the Conference in N.Y, the GSR attend one of the Delegate report back meetings so they can return to the group and inform them of the final outcome on each of the specific Conference agenda items that way the group is kept informed and also can feel they are an active part of the General Service Conference.</p>

<p>Thank you! – Don N., Area 72 Secretary</p>

<p><strong>SOUND AND ZOOM COORDINATION</strong><br>
<a href="mailto:sound@area72aa.org">sound@area72aa.org</a></p>

<p>I suppose when it comes to forming a group conscious, I see it as my duty to provide an informed opinion. And if that opinion is one that has no idea about the subject then to sit back and listen. I have heard that we have 2 ears and 1 mouth, so we should be listening twice as much as we talk. This gives us the opportunity to be a part of vs forcing our ideas on the situation. To allow the moment to change us vs us doing our best to get our opinion out there so we influence the situation. When I practice step 3 I can observe the world from a place of humility. I have found that when I do this my opinion carries a little more weight without it sounding like I'm trying to tell everyone how they should think. When you speak softly your voice can carry far, so I hear.</p>

<p>Bringing this back to group conscious I would say it is all of our duty to put our thoughts out there but then equally as important to respect what it is the group decides. Once the decision is made then we move past it and don't get stuck in mind set that what I had to say was super important and if everyone would just listen then everything would go perfectly.</p>

<p><strong>TECHNOLOGY & WEB CHAIR</strong><br>
<a href="mailto:webchair@area72aa.org">webchair@area72aa.org</a></p>

<p>Greetings, groups of Area 72!</p>

<p>As you meet to contribute to the informed group conscience of Alcoholics Anonymous, I would like to call your attention to some resources you may find helpful.</p>

<p>First off: you can find the agenda items, background material, and summary information on the Area 72 website "Delegate's Corner" <a href="https://area72aa.org/delegates-corner/">https://area72aa.org/delegates-corner/</a></p>

<p>By the time you read this, Delegate Courtney will have already told you all about that via email, newsletter article, pre-conference, District Committee Member, and carrier pigeon.</p>

<p>Here are some additional resources that might help, or at least be interesting, in your conversations about the 2025 Conference agenda items:</p>

<ul>
<li>Advisory Actions of the General Service Conference (<a href="https://www.aa.org/m-39-advisory-actions">https://www.aa.org/m-39-advisory-actions</a>) – a short-form record of all the decisions the General Service Conference has made, beginning in 1951. If a member of your group asks, "When the heck did we decide THAT?!"; this is your go-to resource. It is organized first by committee or category, and then by year within each category.</li>

<li>2024 and 2023 General Service Conference Final Reports (<a href="https://www.aa.org/2024-general-service-conference-final-report">https://www.aa.org/2024-general-service-conference-final-report</a> and <a href="https://www.aa.org/2023-general-service-conference-final-report">https://www.aa.org/2023-general-service-conference-final-report</a>) – several of the agenda items are continued from previous conferences.</li>

<li>All of our literature, for free, in PDF form (<a href="https://www.aa.org/resources/literature">https://www.aa.org/resources/literature</a>) – want to look at the current Cooperation with the Professional Community Workbook, Twelve Steps Illustrated Pamphlet, or Living Sober, all of which will be reviewed at this year's Conference? Go to the literature page, enter the title in the search box, and you're there.</li>
</ul>

<p>I get that not every member wants this level of information... but I think it's important to know that it is available. There is no "they" making decisions that affect "us" – there is only the "We, of Alcoholics Anonymous..." and the basic question: am I willing to exercise my right of participation, to fulfill the responsibility I have to current and future AA members?</p>

<p>Plus I know there's at least one GSR or DCM out there who will clap their hands with glee upon learning of the Advisory Actions pamphlet (ask me how I know...)</p>

<p>Okay! I look forward to hearing what shakes out at this year's Conference! Thank you for contributing to AA's informed group conscience. Please reach out if you have questions or ideas for how the Tech and Web Committee can be helpful to your group. techwebchair@area72aa.org</p>

<p><strong>WEBSERVANT</strong><br>
<a href="mailto:webservant@area72aa.org">webservant@area72aa.org</a></p>

<p>In Alcoholics Anonymous we thrive on unity and collective decision-making, to ensure that our members have a voice in shaping the fellowship's future. One of the most important ways this happens is through the General Service Conference (GSC) and the process of forming a group conscience at our local level. By discussing and sharing topics from the GSC, our AA groups contribute to the broader service structure while staying connected to the principles that guide our recovery.</p>

<p>A group conscience is the collective decision-making process of an AA group, grounded in the principles of AA's Twelve Traditions and Twelve Concepts for World Service. It ensures that our voices are heard and that decisions are made with spiritual integrity rather than personal opinion. The process is not a simple majority vote; rather, it seeks to reach a substantial unanimity (typically two-thirds agreement) through multiple informed discussions.</p>

<p>The General Service Conference is the annual gathering of delegates, trustees, and members from around the world who talk about and make recommendations on a multitude of matters affecting the fellowship. Some of the topics are updates to literature, policies, public outreach, and other initiatives that help AA remain effective in carrying the message of recovery.</p>

<p>Every AA group has an opportunity to participate in this process by reviewing these topics, discussing them at our homegroup, and passing their conscience along through their General Service Representative (GSR) to our Delegate at Area 72.</p>

<p>How do we form a group conscience? We obtain the information that is provided to us by our Delegate either on the website or from our GSR. We familiarize ourselves with the information and topics and attend our homegroup business meeting to share our thoughts on the material, thus developing a group conscience. We all have a voice, we have open discussion, we refer to AA literature and service guidelines and maintain an atmosphere of respect and unity. Allow minority opinions to be heard and work toward a clear group conscience.</p>

<p>The groups GSR is then responsible to carry the groups decisions to the District and Area levels and after the conference and our Delegate returns, the GSR is tasked with reporting back to their group regarding the decisions that were made at the conference.</p>

<p>Engaging in group conscience discussions about GSC topics strengthens AA's structure, ensuring that decisions reflect the fellowship's collective experience rather than a select few. It also helps educate members about AA's service structure and deepens our connection to the broader recovery community.</p>

<p>By participating in this process, every AA group fulfills its responsibility to preserve and carry AA's message for future generations, ensuring that the fellowship continues to serve alcoholics in need.</p>

<p>In love and service,</p>

<p><strong>YOUNG PEOPLE'S CHAIR</strong><br>
<a href="mailto:ypchair@area72aa.org">ypchair@area72aa.org</a></p>

<p>Hello again, Area 72!</p>

<p>We had our first YP quarterly at the end of January and I was so excited to see many YP chairs from several districts. We spent some time orienting to the position and going over the YP handbook and the Area 72 website. We did some brainstorming about ways we can reach young people in the community, as well as how to bring young AA members into general service. I was inspired by the amazing work already happening in many districts. I'm excited to keep collaborating with everyone to make this rotation great. Our next quarterly will be April 26th 12-3 PM at the Lynnwood Alano Club and on zoom. Thank you District 24 for hosting! I can't wait! Flyer and more details to come soon. I hope to see some of you at PRAASA in Alaska. I will be moderating the YP round table on Friday afternoon and I'd love to see some of you there!</p>

<p>As I think about forming a group conscience, I think about my past experiences at the group, district, and area levels. One of the things I love most about AA is the focus put on the minority opinion. I have been at an Area Assembly where the vast majority of people were agreeing on something, but when a member got up and shared his minority opinion, you could feel the room shift. When the body voted again, the outcome had changed! All because someone had the freedom to share their minority opinion without judgement from the group. It was a powerful experience. In my group and at the district level, I've had to learn the importance of listening to understand and learn. As is true with many alcoholics, I usually think I'm right But in AA, I have learned that I'm not always right. When I listen to others, like REALLY listen, I become open to new ideas and I am able to grow. The more experience I have had in chairing committees, the more I have come to appreciate and love the idea of group conscience. It's not about what I want, it's about what the group as a whole wants. It's about unity. It's about letting our higher power guide our decisions and keeping our primary purpose at the front of our minds. It's about serving the still suffering alcoholic.</p>

<p>Please feel free to reach out to me about any YP questions or ideas! I'm excited to have met some new YP chairs within the last month. I'm looking forward to learning from you all! Have a great month!</p>

<p>In love and service,</p>

<p>We are trudging along at D9 with two district meetings under our belt and things are starting to flow nicely. We have a couple positions that came open that we need to fill, one unfortunately due to the passing of a longtime D9 servant, Tom R, who would always make himself available wherever needed. Our GSRs are showing up and participating and are excited to learn and carry the voice of their home groups.</p>

<p>We hosted a GSR school with neighboring south sound districts D44, D45, and D29, which was well attended and very informative! Thank you, Lupita, for coming down to lead that for us!</p>

<p>The South Sound 7 had our first meeting in January, and we got to know our fellow DCMs and ALTDCMs in the south sound. We decided to host a watch party at Puget Sound Central Service office on March 16th of the Northern Districts pre-conference. A few of us will also load up the can for the pre-conference with the Southern Districts in person, looking forward to that!</p>

<p>Looking forward to many more adventures in service and learning opportunities!</p>

<p>Our district business meetings are monthly, normally on the last Sunday of the month. The location varies each month as each group General Service Representative (GSR) gets approval from their group to make their hall available for our two-hour meeting.</p>

<p>We have 19 Groups with GSRs, of which 10 participated in the last district meeting.<br>
We have 24 Trusted Servants, of which 18 participated in the last district meeting.</p>

<p>The newsletter topic this month is "The General Service Conference. Sharing the Topics with your Group...."</p>

<p>Communication is a two-way street. I really like how the General Service Representative Handbook shows such a simplified way on page 4 of the newly revised book just how the communication goes from the AA Groups, to District meetings, then to Area Assembly, and then to the General Service Conference and back again.</p>

<p>District 10 is one of the districts where we will attend any one of the five scheduled Pre-Conference meetings in the South, North, East, and Central Area locations along with a virtual-only meeting. We will be discussing this at our next district business meeting on the 23rd of February at the 9th & McKenzie Group Hall.</p>

<p>We had our GSR School - yay it was great! Our Area 72 Alt Delegate Lupita was awesome and very inspiring. Lots of great information was shared and it was so great to collaborate with Districts 3, 12, 19, 24, 42 and everyone else that was involved. We had great attendance both in person and on Zoom.</p>

<p>Continued planning for Pre-Conference in Mt Vernon. Initially there were questions about sound that seem to have been resolved from experience gained from GSR School. District 24 will run Zoom and sound at this event too. It's been fun collaborating with Districts 2,3,4,11,12,19,24,42,46 and we look forward to having Pierce Counties districts join us online.</p>

<p>Got a list together of District 12 Committee Chairs contact info attending quarterlies that we don't have Chairs for. Working on a Zoom system for business meeting. Keep posting info to District 12 committee for groups. Working on getting groups involved in District 12.</p>

<p>Haven't had the time to carry message to District 12 groups so asking Groups to announce in district 12 meeting we would love to have them get involved.</p>

<p>Super looking forward to Pre Conference - these events are so fun and rewarding coming together. Hoping to get more groups involved and people to Chair committee spots that are open.</p>

<p>District 12 looks forward to working together in the Spirit of Unity with all our neighboring Districts.</p>

<p>Greetings from District 14!<br>
Well I blinked and it's already almost March! District 14 held our second business meeting of the panel, which would be more aptly named our "Monthly District Conscience" meeting. As a group, our committee chairs were very enthusiastic about their first quarterly committee meetings and shared excitement for the work ahead.</p>

<p>Building a group conscience and sharing the topics from the General Service Conference is a task that requires teamwork. Teamwork is a topic which is foremost on my mind today, the day after a super team of DCM's and Alt-DCM's from eight districts centered around Seattle came together to host a GSR School at Greater Seattle Intergroup.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to the next step in building this Area conscience, which will come with the Pre-Conferences in March. Our tight-knit Central Seattle Districts are actively planning our Pre-Conference, which will be held on Sunday, March 23 at St John United Lutheran Church in Phinney Ridge.</p>

<p>I'll admit that I was anxious about how we would coordinate important gatherings like GSR Schools and Pre-Conferences when I started this panel. Now I get to be super grateful for the teamwork and fellowship I've already experienced with my friends from the other Seattle Districts and support received from across the Area.</p>

<p><strong>Accomplishments from the past quarter:</strong><br>
Alongside other DCMs, Taylor and I helped plan the GSR School hosted at GSIG on Feb 22. It was great to see all the other DCMs and GSRs!<br>
We participated in planning for the Central Districts Pre-Conference.<br>
Natalie became our district registrar at our February meeting.<br>
Woodland Park Women has continued to take a meeting into a Swedish facility for pregnant people with alcohol and substance abuse issues.<br>
We started using our area Google accounts to organize our district minutes, event flyers, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Goals you hope to achieve or begin work on in the next quarter:</strong><br>
We will plan to attend the Pre-Conference on March 23. Hoping to see as many GSRs as possible there.</p>

<p>The past month has been about making service at the District as attractive as possible. We returned to the venue that we were at prior to Covid. It felt great to be back there. We filled our Corrections Chair position and have a hopeful candidate for Webmaster. That leaves our Accessibility Chair vacant.</p>

<p>Our Alt. DCM, Lee R., had worked as our Registrar to get everyone registered at the Area. I visited a couple of meetings and introduced myself, I plan to continue this trend.</p>

<p>We have worked together with the Eastern Districts to coordinate a venue for the Pre-Conference and had a great turnout at the GSR School with the Central Districts held at the Seattle Intergroup office.</p>

<p>District 18 has a bit of an identity crisis between Central and Eastern Districts and the confusion of being served by Seattle Intergroup rather than Eastside Intergroup, but it's a good lesson that the categorization of Districts has nothing to do with Intergroups necessarily because General Service is not the same as Intergroup Service, it is parallel to it.</p>

<p>I continue to be humbled by this service and am more in love with AA than ever.</p>

<p><strong>The General Service Conference Sharing the Topics with your Group</strong></p>

<p>Attending the pre-conference is the beginning of the process to form a group conscience through sharing the topics from the General Service Conference. Every year our Area 72 Delegate prepares for the General Service Conference and meets with the GSRs at the pre-conference assemblies.</p>

<p>Part of your job as GSR is to attend these meetings, take notes, then share the topics with your group. On page 35 of the Area 72 GSR handbook you will find tips to help you when you give reports to your group. These are also helpful for sharing the topics from the pre-conference.</p>

<p>In the pamphlet G.S.R. General Service Representative Your group's link to A.A. as a whole it says: "You transmit ideas and opinions, as well as facts; through you, the group conscience becomes a part of the collective conscience of our whole fellowship as expressed in the General Service Conference."</p>

<p><strong>March report</strong><br>
The Area Accessibility Chair, Bud W., asked District 25 if he might present info on the work and workings of this committee and how best District 25 might add to the success of those goals. At the time of Bud's initial request District 25 did not have a chairperson in place, but by the time of the next scheduled (February) business meeting wherein Bud would present we had voted in Arrin R.</p>

<p><strong>The General Service Conference, Sharing the Topics With Your Group</strong></p>

<p>I was sick in bed with pneumonia when our Area Delegate, Courtney S., reached out via email regarding the necessity of setting up a date for an online pre-conference on the topics being discussed at the next conference.</p>

<p>This is just another thing I love about what A.A. is teaching me (us): To give myself time to think, gather information, listen and then voice my ideas/opinions and to join in the voting process knowing that every vote is important.</p>

<p><strong>"FORMING A GROUP CONSCIENCE"</strong></p>

<p>Our District has been growing since Covid. People doing service has also increased. District 27's PI/CPC committee had asked for, and received, an increase in their monthly budget from a group conscience. Big Books have been bought for jails in our district and we are working on other jails receiving copies soon.</p>

<p>All of these decisions are done by having a group conscience. We also have someone making themselves available for our Corrections and Treatment Chair next month. This is going to help tremendously in carrying the message of AA to those that may want "a way out".</p>

<p>We are getting organized!</p>

<p>Our February district meeting became highly animated when discussing the 2025 budget. The big contentious point was the allotted funds to the Chairs and approval of what they spend it on. The bright side was them wanting to know the guidelines on how to utilize the money to best fulfill the goals of helping the alcoholic in need of the services we're capable of providing.</p>

<p>Greetings from District 29. Things are going well with robust attendance at the monthly business meeting. The groups and district are actively involved in all areas of service and there is an air of excitement about expanding our message to the alcoholics who still suffer. Meeting attendance is up in most groups.</p>

<p>We have an active Third Legacy Program and have been speaking at many group birthday night celebrations. I look forward to the next quarterly in April.</p>

<p><strong>"The Conference"</strong></p>

<p>My service sponsor has been educating me on this process. First, a little history. The General Service Conference (known as the "Conference") was born to replace our co-founders Bill W. & Bob S., mortal men. It came about in 1951 for A.A. to truly be independent of Bill & Bob and take on a life of its own.</p>

<p>Our service structure process is that each group elects a Group Service Representative (GSR), who attends the District meetings. Each district elects a District Committee Member (DCM) to carry the districts' group conscience to the Area Quarterlies. The GSRs and DCMs elect our Delegate at the Assembly who carries our area's conscience to the Conference.</p>

<p>Now you can see how important it is for all the service positions to be filled along this chain of communication from the groups to the Conference and back again. I hope every group has a GSR and attends the Pre-Conference in March, where our Delegate, Courtney, will give us the Pre-Conference agenda items.</p>

<p>When we think about the A.A. group conscience and its importance, it is good to think about the inverted triangle that represents the "Structure of the Conference" and that the "final authority" does not rest upon the few, in this case the General Service Board. But, instead, this ultimate authority is the responsibility of the groups of A.A.</p>

<p>Many of us find ourselves in a new rotation of service and new to our service positions. We must rely on our relationships and the fellowship to seek out advice and suggestions on effective ways to share information, review/collaborate, and consider A.A. as a whole before reporting back what our thoughts are on any given topic or request to our Delegate.</p>

<p>As Pre-Conferences approach, I am excited to partner with my fellows to determine the best way to be of service to its members and our groups while forming a group conscience.</p>

<p>As we gather in our various meetings and share our stories, it's essential to remember that our collective voice holds incredible power. One of the most impactful ways we can harness that power is by discussing the topics brought up at the Pre-Conference Assembly.</p>

<p><strong>Why Share Pre-Conference Topics?</strong><br>
When we discuss the issues and suggestions that emerge from the Pre-Conference, we open the door for our groups to provide valuable feedback. This feedback is crucial—it's our chance to contribute to the broader conversation within AA and ensure that our collective experiences and insights make their way to our Area Delegate.</p>

<p><strong>The Upside-Down Triangle of AA Service</strong><br>
One of the foundational principles of AA is the upside-down triangle, which symbolizes the structure of our service organization. At the top of the triangle are the AA groups, followed by group GSRs, districts, area assemblies, the General Service Conference, and finally, the General Service Board at the bottom.</p>

<p>Hello fellow trusted servants, it has been a great month to be a member of AA in the Snoqualmie Valley. Our district meeting in February hosted our Area Accessibility Chair, Bud W, for a presentation and questions on accessibility in AA.</p>

<p>The newsletter topic for this month, Forming a Group Conscience, is particularly interesting as we discuss the Area topics and receive information from the Delegate on the GSC. What is my role as DCM and group member to achieve a group conscience? I think my most important role in a group conscience is to listen.</p>

<p>Upon a thorough review of District 41's finances, we found that while our contributions have halved each year since 2022, our expenses have remained relatively consistent. Consequently, we must make some tough budget decisions to be fully self-supporting and financially responsible.</p>

<p>To meet our budget shortfalls, we are exploring several options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Increasing outreach efforts</li>
<li>Utilizing 7th tradition opportunities</li>
<li>Organizing fundraising events</li>
<li>Seeking support from other districts for shared expenses</li>
</ul>

<p>For instance, if your district is interested in collaborating on a booth at this year's Pride Festival, please contact Ganelle H, Alt DCM of District 41.</p>

<p>Hello everyone, I remember when I went to my first group conscience (at the advice of my sponsor). I was why do I need to go to this, I was only about six months sober at the time. Then I saw what and how it operated.</p>

<p>I have formed a couple of group consciences for different groups, and setting up the responsibilities of each position is very important to help keep the group informed how it is being conducted and where and the monies are being spent.</p>

<p>I do believe the best group conscience is one where everybody has the opportunity to be heard, and if someone has something they think is important then they should be looked into, instead of just shutting it down. I learned that the hard way.</p>

<p>District 45 is happy and grateful to be working to help the still sick and suffering thru Valentines day and we have had some cold weather.</p>

<p>The district just hosted a very well attended GSR School with Lupita rocking the service house with a bunch of great topics. Just a few were touched upon:</p>

<ul>
<li>The most important service position in AA is the GSR.</li>
<li>Sometimes suiting up and showing up is the best we can do</li>
<li>Exploring the Area 72 website is crucial</li>
<li>Important Dates were talked about</li>
</ul>

<p>Pierce County doesn't have a face-to-face meeting for the pre-conference so we are organized and are having a viewing party of the Northern Districts Pre-Conference March 15th 10-2 at our local CSO office.</p>

<p>We have several positions that still need to be filled: PI, Accessibilities, Grapevine and literature, and District Registrar.</p>

<p>In thinking back to when I was a GSR, I recall the difficulties of getting all of the General Service Conference information in front of my Homegroup to establish our Group conscience given the limited time allotted by my Homegroup.</p>

<p>We found it beneficial to form a small group out of the Homegroup members to attend a "General Service Pre-conference" review. This is where we looked at the various topics and questions that our Delegate needed a response on.</p>

<p>Given the condensed timeframe, it's important to attend the Delegate's Pre-conference meeting. Quite often, the topics seem to evolve and the Delegate's emphasis on many topics may shift.</p>

<p><strong>Forming a Group Conscience</strong><br>
Learning this is an important part of my spiritual growth in AA. and how to keep a home group healthy. How often do we hear talk in a meeting about how long someone shares for too long? Or do we need better topics?</p>

<p>I like this meeting the way it is, do we want to stay hybrid? Does your meeting lose members? Do you attend your home group business meeting? That's where we learn about a group Conscience and learning the principles of AA to stay sober.</p>

<p>My new service position on the Board of EastSide Intergroup is going to help me learn a lot more about practicing these principles in all my affairs, learning how to listen is the first one that comes to mind.</p>

<p>Check out our website, <a href="http://eastsideaa.org">eastsideaa.org</a> for all our events like our Pancake Breakfast coming up March 15th.</p>

<p>The new service rotation at Greater Seattle Intergroup is off to a great start. Many of our service Chair positions have been filled and the groups in our service area have stepped-up and help make the first two months of 2025 financially positive.</p>

<p>Some of the highlights of the past month have included: a wonderful visit to our monthly Board meeting from AA General Service Trustee Carolyn W of British Columbia to share with us about the upcoming International Conference in Vancouver; continued recruitment for our online chat service; and planning for the upcoming Burien Little Assembly.</p>

<p>Additionally as a start to the new service rotation the Seattle Intergroup Board has sent a letter to be read by GSRs to every AA group in the greater Seattle area, describing the work GSIG does to support groups.</p>

<p><strong>Service Work, Works for Me</strong><br>
The traditions Of Alcoholics' Anonymous are based upon unity as described in Tradition One and Two. They emphasize humility. unity, and trust in a loving God expressed through the group conscious.</p>

<p>Therefore, the one voice represents all the voices of the members of the group and is called the group conscious. AA is unusual, as most organizations have one person making the decisions for all to follow.</p>

<p>Being in harmony with each other gives us the power to serve and carry the message. We need the new comer as much as they need us. We are the arms and legs of our higher power when being in service where we are called.</p>

<p>Suggesting the newcomer get into service is a wonderful way to involve their coming to meetings. There were times as the coffeemaker or ashtray cleaner, in the old days, I had to be there, even though I did not want to go to the meeting. I always heard what I needed to hear.</p>

<p>I was so insecure, and shy when first in AA, I kept in the background. I needed to learn to speak up, reach out, and be supportive of another. The interesting part of my sponsor keeping me involved was that in helping others, I found more of myself.</p>

<p>I have personally adopted the Responsibility Statement: I am responsible. When anyone, anywhere, reaches out for help, I want the hand of AA always to be there. And for that, I am responsible.</p>

<p>Being in service has brought me a better life. I have become the person I always wanted to be. Without Alcoholics Anonymous and being in service work, I would not have been able to help my friend.</p>
